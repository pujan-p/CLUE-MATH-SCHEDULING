# SCHEDULING CLUE MATH TUTORS FOR AUTUMN QUARTERS
## LIAM CHU, DIANNA E, TYLER FRANCK, SARAH MATHISON, PUJAN PATEL
Abstract. The Center for Learning and Undergraduate Enrichment (CLUE) is an academic support program 
at the University of Washington that provides drop-in tutoring for a wide range of subjects. Historically,
the demand for math tutoring has vastly exceeded that of other subjects, and recently, the program has
struggled to meet this demand. This is particularly true for autumn quarter as students, refreshed from
summer break, are especially energized and motivated to succeed. Unfortunately, the inability to meet this
demand means that many students are often turned away without receiving any help at all. In this paper,
we hope to bridge the gap between supply and demand by developing software to more intelligently schedule
tutors according to the trends of past autumn quarters. More specifically, we develop a non-linear programming 
model to find the weekly tutoring schedule that best aligns with the predicted daily demand whilst
adhering to the personal and institutional constraints put forth by tutors and program management.
